## Documentation

WooCommerce Product Fees allows you to add additional fees at checkout based on products that are in the cart. In the WooCommerce products edit screen, there will be a new product data tab called 'Product Fees' where you can:

* Give the fee a custom name that is displayed to the customer at checkout describing the fee.
* Enter the cost of the fee as either a flat rate number, or a percenatage.
* Choose whether or not the fee should be multiplied based on the quanitity of the product in the cart.

= Features =

I have kept this plugin simple on purpose. It is very lightweight, and should not conflict with any other plugins or themes. I plan to continually add new features, such as category fees and variation specific fees. But for now the two main feature include:

* Percentage based fees that go off of the product's price.
* The ability to toggle on and off the quantity multiplier per product.
